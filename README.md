>The lack of a consistent framework for continual learning and unlearning makes it difficult to develop flexible models that can learn and forget dynamically. Disjointed techniques are limited in their ability to adapt to new knowledge while removing outdated or sensitive information, making them unsuitable for real-world applications.We compare the isolated continual learning, machine unlearning problems to the unified continual learning-unlearning (CLUL) problem.We propose a controlled knowledge distillation framework for managing continual learning and unlearning operations.
